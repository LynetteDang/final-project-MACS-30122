At Penn and in collaboration with Lila Gleitman and Heidi Feldman, she began her studies exploring whether children who lack a (usable) model for language can nevertheless create a language with their hands. She has found that deaf children whose profound hearing losses prevent them from learning the speech than surrounds them, and whose hearing parents have not exposed them to sign, invent gesture systems which are structured in language-like ways. This interest in how the manual modality can serve the needs of communication and thinking led to her current work on the gestures that accompany speech in hearing individuals. She has found that gesture can convey substantive information \u2013 information that is often not expressed in the speech it accompanies. Gesture can thus reveal secrets of the mind to those who pay attention."}, "Leslie Kay": {"Linked Page": "https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/leslie-m-kay", "Directory Page": "https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/directory/leslie-kay", "University": "I received my BA in Liberal Arts from St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico and then worked for the original GenBank project at Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1982-85.
