The book develops a theory based on conflict escalation dynamics, showing that states use covert intervention and conceal others' covert activity to keep war limited. An article analyzing the secret side of the Korean War was published in International Organization. His second book project, in collaboration with Allison Carnegie (Columbia), analyzes the role of intelligence and other forms of sensitive information in international organizations. His other research addresses the signaling value of covert action, secrecy's role in insulating international regimes from damaging rule violations, and dynamics of limited war.

A year spent at the Piagetian Institute in Geneva while an undergraduate at Smith College piqued her interest in the relationship between language and thought, interests she continued to pursue in her doctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D. 1975). At Penn and in collaboration with Lila Gleitman and Heidi Feldman, she began her studies exploring whether children who lack a (usable) model for language can nevertheless create a language with their hands. She has found that deaf children whose profound hearing losses prevent them from learning the speech than surrounds them, and whose hearing parents have not exposed them to sign, invent gesture systems which are structured in language-like ways. This interest in how the manual modality can serve the needs of communication and thinking led to her current work on the gestures that accompany speech in hearing individuals. She has found that gesture can convey substantive information – information that is often not expressed in the speech it accompanies. Gesture can thus reveal secrets of the mind to those who pay attention.","[[('Susan Goldin-Meadow', 'PERSON'), ('the Beardsley Ruml Distinguished Service', 'FAC'), ('the Department of Psychology and Committee on Human Development', 'ORG'), ('the University of Chicago', 'ORG')], [('A year', 'DATE'), ('the Piagetian Institute', 'ORG'), ('Geneva', 'GPE'), ('Smith College', 'ORG'), ('the University of Pennsylvania (', 'ORG'), ('1975', 'DATE')], [('Penn', 'PERSON'), ('Lila Gleitman', 'PERSON'), ('Heidi Feldman', 'PERSON')], [], [], [], []]",the University of Pennsylvania (

Du Bois Collective Research Institute. Both appointments continue to frame my developmental scholarship and application of phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST). It is a systems theory and, most important, is inclusive of all human experience and provides an identity-focused cultural ecological perspective. I evolved the theory over a decade because non-problematizing perspectives about people of color were generally unavailable.  Accordingly, P-VEST affords an authentic representation of human development processes both for Whites and People of Color as lives evolve in an ethnically, racially and economically diverse world. The conceptual framework addresses resiliency, identity, and competence formation processes for diverse humans—particularly youth—both in the United States and abroad.  ","[[('PhD', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the Committee on Human Development', 'ORG'), ('the Department of Comparative Human Development', 'ORG'), ('the Child and Developmental Psychology Program', 'ORG')], [('Chicago', 'GPE'), ('Board of Overseers Professor', 'ORG'), ('the Interdisciplinary Studies of Human Development', 'ORG'), ('ISHD', 'ORG'), ('the Graduate School of Education', 'ORG'), ('the University of Pennsylvania', 'ORG')], [('UPenn', 'GPE'), (""the University of Pennsylvania's"", 'ORG'), ('Center for Health Achievement Neighborhoods Growth and Ethnic Studies', 'ORG'), ('W.

The symbol, understood both sensuously and conceptually, proved a focal point for investigating how the means of representation make possible a shared world of reasons and, what is more difficult, experiences.

These interests intersect with others in the logic of fiction, art historiography, cartoons, comics and caricatures, popular music and science fiction, beauty and ugliness.
